## Introduction

Linked lists are fundamental data structures that are essential for any software engineer to master. They form the basis of many complex data structures and algorithms. Understanding linked lists will not only help you in coding interviews but also enhance your overall problem-solving skills.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the exercises, make sure you are comfortable with:

- Basic programming concepts (variables, control structures, functions)
- Understanding of pointers or references (depending on your programming language)
- Basic data structures like arrays and lists

## Exercises

The exercises are categorized into three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level includes a list of problems to solve, along with their corresponding LeetCode links where applicable.

### Basic Operations

#### 1. Implement a Singly Linked List

- **Description**: Create a singly linked list with basic operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement methods to insert at the head, tail, and a specific index.
  - Implement methods to delete from the head, tail, and a specific index.
  - Write a method to search for a value in the list.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 707: Design Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/)

#### 2. Reverse a Linked List

- **Description**: Reverse a singly linked list.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 206: Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

#### 3. Detect a Cycle in a Linked List

- **Description**: Determine if a linked list has a cycle.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 141: Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

#### 4. Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists

- **Description**: Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

### Intermediate Challenges

#### 5. Remove Nth Node From End

- **Description**: Remove the Nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 19: Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

#### 6. Find the Middle of a Linked List

- **Description**: Find the middle node of a linked list.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 876: Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

#### 7. Delete a Node in a Linked List

- **Description**: Delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 237: Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

#### 8. Partition List

- **Description**: Partition a linked list around a value x.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 86: Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

### Advanced Problems

- **Description**: Reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 25: Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

#### 10. Copy List with Random Pointer

- **Description**: A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer. Make a deep copy of the list.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 138: Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

#### 11. LRU Cache Implementation

- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 146: LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

#### 12. Merge k Sorted Lists

- **Description**: Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.
- **Practice**:
  - [LeetCode 23: Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

## Tips for Success

- **Understand Pointer Manipulation**: Many linked list problems require careful manipulation of pointers or references. Draw diagrams to visualize the changes.
- **Practice Edge Cases**: Pay attention to edge cases like empty lists, single-node lists, and cycles.
- **Write Clean Code**: Use meaningful variable names and keep your code organized to reduce errors.
- **Test Your Code**: After writing a function, test it with different inputs to ensure it handles all scenarios.
- **Learn Common Patterns**: Familiarize yourself with common linked list patterns like fast and slow pointers, reversing in-place, and recursive approaches.
