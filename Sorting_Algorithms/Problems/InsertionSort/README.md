# Sorting Algorithm Practice Problems


## Insertion Sort

1. Sort an array of integers in ascending order: [9, 5, 1, 4, 3]
2. Sort an array of integers in descending order: [22, 11, 99, 88, 9, 7, 42]
3. Sort an array of characters alphabetically: ['F', 'A', 'D', 'B', 'E', 'C']
4. Implement insertion sort to arrange books by their page count: [300, 150, 425, 80, 200, 120]
5. Sort a list of words by their last letter: ["hello", "world", "algorithm", "computer", "science"]
6. Arrange a list of temperatures (in Celsius) from coldest to hottest: [-5, 10, 35, 0, 25, -15]
7. Sort an array of integers, but keep all negative numbers at their original positions: [4, -2, 9, 1, -5, 6, 3, -8]
8. Implement insertion sort for a list of custom objects (e.g., Movie with title and rating) based on rating
9. Sort a list of IP addresses in ascending order: ["192.168.0.1", "10.0.0.1", "172.16.0.1", "192.168.1.1"]
10. Arrange a list of RGB colors based on their overall brightness (R+G+B): ["#FF0000", "#00FF00", "#0000FF", "#FFFFFF", "#000000"]
