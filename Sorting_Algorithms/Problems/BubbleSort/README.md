# Sorting Algorithm Practice Problems

## Bubble Sort

1. Sort an array of integers in ascending order: [5, 2, 8, 12, 1, 6]
2. Sort an array of integers in descending order: [15, 7, 3, 9, 14, 2]
3. Sort an array of strings alphabetically: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
4. Implement bubble sort to arrange students by their heights (in cm): [165, 170, 160, 175, 155, 180]
5. Sort a list of decimal numbers: [3.14, 1.41, 2.71, 0.58, 1.73, 2.24]
6. Arrange a list of words by their length: ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "rhinoceros", "bird"]
7. Sort an array of integers, but place all even numbers before odd numbers: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4, 3, 7]
8. Implement bubble sort for a list of custom objects (e.g., Person with name and age) based on age
9. Sort a list of dates in chronological order: ["2023-05-15", "2022-11-30", "2024-01-01", "2023-09-22"]
10. Arrange a list of playing cards by their rank (Ace is highest): ["7♠", "K♣", "2♥", "A♦", "J♠", "Q♥"]
