# Sorting Algorithm Practice Problems


## Selection Sort

1. Sort an array of integers in ascending order: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
2. Sort an array of integers in descending order: [1, 10, 5, 8, 7, 6, 4]
3. Sort an array of fruits alphabetically: ["orange", "apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi"]
4. Implement selection sort to arrange students by their test scores: [85, 92, 78, 95, 88, 70]
5. Sort a list of words by the number of vowels they contain: ["rhythm", "symphony", "melody", "harmony", "tune"]
6. Sort an array of integers, but place all multiples of 3 at the end: [3, 1, 2, 6, 4, 9, 5, 7, 8]
7. Sort a list of chemical elements by their atomic number: ["Oxygen", "Carbon", "Hydrogen", "Nitrogen", "Helium"]
8. Arrange a list of geometric shapes by their number of sides: ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "hexagon", "circle"]
