# Sorting and Searching Algorithm Practice Problems

## Bubble Sort

1. Sort an array of integers in ascending order: [5, 2, 8, 12, 1, 6]
2. Sort an array of integers in descending order: [15, 7, 3, 9, 14, 2]
3. Sort an array of strings alphabetically: ["elderberry", "date", "cherry", "banana", "apple"]
4. Arrange a list of words by their length: ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "rhinoceros", "bird"]
5. Sort an array of integers, but place all even numbers before odd numbers: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4, 3, 7]
6. Sort a list of dates in chronological order: ["2023-05-15","2023-04-15", "2023-05-14", "2022-11-30", "2024-01-01", "2023-09-22"]

## Insertion Sort

1. Sort an array of integers in ascending order: [9, 5, 1, 4, 3]
2. Sort an array of integers in descending order: [22, 11, 99, 88, 9, 7, 42]
3. Sort an array of characters alphabetically: ['F', 'A', 'D', 'B', 'E', 'C']
4. Implement insertion sort to arrange books by their page count: [300, 150, 425, 80, 200, 120]
5. Sort a list of words by their last letter: ["hello", "world", "algorithm", "computer", "science"]
6. Arrange a list of temperatures (in Celsius) from coldest to hottest: [-5, 10, 35, 0, 25, -15]
7. Sort an array of integers, but keep all negative numbers at their original positions: [4, -2, 9, 1, -5, 6, 3, -8]
8. Implement insertion sort for a list of custom objects (e.g., Movie with title and rating) based on rating
9. Sort a list of IP addresses in ascending order: ["192.168.0.1", "10.0.0.1", "172.16.0.1", "192.168.1.1"]
10. Arrange a list of RGB colors based on their overall brightness (R+G+B): ["#FF0000", "#00FF00", "#0000FF", "#FFFFFF", "#000000"]

## Selection Sort

1. Sort an array of integers in ascending order: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
2. Sort an array of integers in descending order: [1, 10, 5, 8, 7, 6, 4]
3. Sort an array of fruits alphabetically: ["orange", "apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi"]
4. Implement selection sort to arrange students by their test scores: [85, 92, 78, 95, 88, 70]
5. Sort a list of words by the number of vowels they contain: ["rhythm", "symphony", "melody", "harmony", "tune"]
6. Arrange a list of countries by their population (in millions): [1441, 331, 273, 220, 149, 126]
7. Sort an array of integers, but place all multiples of 3 at the end: [3, 1, 2, 6, 4, 9, 5, 7, 8]
8. Implement selection sort for a list of custom objects (e.g., Car with make and year) based on year
9. Sort a list of chemical elements by their atomic number: ["Oxygen", "Carbon", "Hydrogen", "Nitrogen", "Helium"]
10. Arrange a list of geometric shapes by their number of sides: ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "hexagon", "circle"]

## Binary Search

1. Search for the number 42 in a sorted array: [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 42, 56, 72, 91]
2. Find the index of "cherry" in an alphabetically sorted array: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig", "grape"]
3. Implement binary search to find a student's name in a sorted list of 100 names
4. Search for the number 17 in a large sorted array of 10,000 integers
5. Find the insertion point for a new number in a sorted array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] (e.g., insert 35)
6. Implement binary search for a list of custom objects (e.g., Product with name and price) based on price
7. Search for a specific date in a chronologically sorted array of dates
8. Find the first occurrence of a repeated element in a sorted array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]
9. Implement binary search for a sorted array of floating-point numbers
10. Use binary search to find the square root of a number (with a given precision)

Remember to implement each sorting algorithm from scratch and use the binary search algorithm for the searching problems. These exercises will help you practice and understand the algorithms better. Good luck!
