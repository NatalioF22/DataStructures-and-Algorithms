# Search Algorithms Problems

## Binary Search

1. Search for the number 42 in a sorted array: [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 42, 56, 72, 91]
2. Find the index of "cherry" in an alphabetically sorted array: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig", "grape"]
3. Implement binary search to find a student's name in a sorted list of 100 names
4. Search for the number 17 in a large sorted array of 10,000 integers
5. Find the insertion point for a new number in a sorted array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] (e.g., insert 35)
6. Implement binary search for a list of custom objects (e.g., Product with name and price) based on price
7. Search for a specific date in a chronologically sorted array of dates
8. Find the first occurrence of a repeated element in a sorted array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]
9. Implement binary search for a sorted array of floating-point numbers
10. Use binary search to find the square root of a number (with a given precision)

Remember to implement each sorting algorithm from scratch and use the binary search algorithm for the searching problems. These exercises will help you practice and understand the algorithms better. Good luck!
